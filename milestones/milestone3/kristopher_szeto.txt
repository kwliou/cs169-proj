observed project's webpage: white-board.heroku.com

the site already looks like a finished product. The most interesting feature
is definitely the drawing feature. I originally expected the board's "new" view to be where
a chunk of the code would be, but it turns out that most of the work is done in the "show" view,
and of course the board model. In fact, other than the "show" view, all other views are suprisingly simple.
The show view involves a lot of use of javascript, a lot more than that used by our group, and it 
definitely required a lot of time and effort. Overall it looks very professional compared to most of
the other groups in the class, however, it seems that main feature is really just drawing on the board.
While from a coding prespective, the app is really impressive, from a user's stand point, it really isn't
that special. Since whiteboards are often used for brain storming, it may be a good idea to include a
feature that allows users to switch between drawing and typing with ease.
