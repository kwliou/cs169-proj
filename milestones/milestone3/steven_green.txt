I checked out the Beatmap app. (beatmap.heroku.com)

The site is supposed to show you a heatmap of nearby events and
restaurants. I guess that means that exciting places should show up as
big blobs? Anyway I checked out their code and what they had wasn't
really a heatmap. They had hardcoded in about 13 red spot images and
then they overlay them on a map returned by Google maps. So each
hotspot only encompasses one location and doesn't neccessarily grow
any larger if there is a lot of stuff nearby. I don't really get how
they added any functionality to Yelp since their heatmaps are just icons
in the exact locations that Yelp returns from a search. Also clicking on 
one of the icons simply pops up an address and not the business name. 
Perhaps this feature is still a work in progress? It would be a more 
interesting app if they handled more than just a few results from Yelp 
or if there was color variation in their dots to represent the rating
instead of just a change in opacity which is what they have now.
A heatmap with less than 20 data points doesn't really make for much of 
a heatmap. I don't mean to sound super mean, I'm just tired. I'm sure
they've worked really hard.
