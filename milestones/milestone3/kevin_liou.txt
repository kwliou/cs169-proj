I tried out Project Jukebox.
The site wasn't finished concerning overall layout and none of the AJAX worked.
One cool feature is that you can upload pictures.
They do this by having s3 storage and has_attached_file in the user model. It looks like a cool idea, and they have scenarios, but currently it isn't working.
